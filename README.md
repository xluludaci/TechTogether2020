(Sidenote, the desktop github and terminal on Xi's win computer weirdly always freeze to forever,  so the commit time is subject to inaccuracy. Thank for understanding.)


* Devise method to assist manual text data annotation
* Design and implement text classifier for short and data-scarse domain (medical/bio-medical) text binary classification
* Evaluate annotation tool UI/UX design
* Evaluate the effectivity of the proposed annotation-assisting method

# Challenges

Prototype and grandually improve the annotation process to get high-quality human annotation quickly.

Domain-specific and data-scarse text classification problem. Many out-of-vocabulary words due to the hardness and cost to get enough useful and accessible in-domain data.

Develop and improve transfer learning technique to enhance classifier.
